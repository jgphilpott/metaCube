# Intro

The metaCube is a 3D printable cube with a recursive geometric pattern. It was designed using [Polymaker](https://github.com/jgphilpott/polymaker/tree/d55b8437e9b6397aa67eb8bc4a55f97a627fced7), the [STL files](https://github.com/jgphilpott/metaCube/tree/f6e80381e360176af368a6ab4b65f1c4cfd156c1/stl) can be downloaded from this repository or from **[Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4539280)**. This repository also contains the [G-code files](https://github.com/jgphilpott/metaCube/tree/f6e80381e360176af368a6ab4b65f1c4cfd156c1/gcode) that were used in the initial print, they were sliced using [Cura](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura) and printed on an [Ender 5 Pro](https://3dprintingcanada.com/collections/3d-printers/products/creality-ender-5-pro).
